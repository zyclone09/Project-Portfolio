This repository is a personal engineering portfolio. If you spot typos or want to propose improvements to formatting, feel free to open a pull request.

## Media guidance
- Prefer compressed images (JPEG/WebP ≤ 2000px wide).
- Store raw/high-res footage outside Git, and reference via links or Git LFS.
- Name files descriptively: `YYYY-MM-DD-step-name.jpg` for build logs.

## Markdown tips
- Keep sections short, add diagrams/images every ~2–3 paragraphs.
- Use tables for parts lists and specs.
- Use collapsible sections (`<details>`) for long logs.
