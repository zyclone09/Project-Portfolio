## 1) Overview
- **Dates:** Feb–Sept 2021
- **Tools:** Hand tools, torque wrench, calipers, Loctite, CAD (for brackets)
- **Skills:** Mechanical assembly, alignment, mounting design, safety checks, prototyping, maintanance
- **Outcome:** A fun motorized bike that runs on a 2-Stroke 89cc engine that reaches 54 kph

- Had initially designed to have the engine mounted on the top frame and seat column however with issues in mounting brackets and misaligned chain position.

- Mounting the engine inside the frame was a step towards improvement however the chassis was too small for the carbutor to fit, used an L bracket and temperature resistant steel epoxy for a workaround.

- Ran multiple tests alongside prototyping and troubleshooting ideas for enhancing the ride quality and ensuring safety.
