## Highlights
- **Parametric Shaft & Hub** — correct GD&T, transition fits.
- **Sheetmetal Bracket** — flat pattern, bend allowances.
- **Assembly with BOM** — exploded view + callouts.

## Exports
- PDF drawings (`/media`).
- Optional STEP/IGES for neutral sharing.

## Reflection (STAR)
- **Situation:** Practising CAD beyond coursework to build drafting fluency.  
- **Task:** Produce clean drawings with correct dimensioning & tolerances.  
- **Action:** Iterated models, checked standards, reviewed fits and fasteners.  
- **Result:** Faster modelling, fewer revision cycles, better manufacturability.
