## Exports
- PDF drawings (`/media`).
- Optional STEP/IGES for neutral sharing.

## Reflection (STAR)
- **Situation:** Practising CAD beyond coursework to build drafting fluency.  
- **Task:** Produce clean drawings with correct dimensioning & tolerances.  
- **Action:** Iterated models, checked standards, reviewed fits and fasteners.  
- **Result:** Faster modelling, fewer revision cycles, better manufacturability.
